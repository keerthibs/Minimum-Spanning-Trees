# Minimum-Spanning-Trees
This project has codes that implements various methods to find a minimum spanning tree such as Kruskal, Prim using Heaps, Prim using Indexed Heaps.


//This repo has the code for Long Project 2 - Finding MST for the graphs

1. Prim1
2. Prim2 
3. Kruskals

File Details:

1) Prim1.java has the driver function to find MST implementing Prim1 algorithm.
it has MST() function which has the code for implementing Prim’s algorithm using traditional priority queue.

2) Prim2.java has the driver function to find MST implementing Prim2 algorithm. It has findMST() function which has the code for implementing Prim’s algorithm using indexed Priority queue.

3) Driver_Krushkal.java has the driver function to find MST implementing Krushkal’s algorithm.

4) IndexedPriorityQueue.java has the implementation of indexed priority queue which has functions like insert(), removeMin(), decreaseKey()

5) Krushkal.java has the code which shows the implementation of Kruskal’s algorithm.
